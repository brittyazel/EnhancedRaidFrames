# Enhanced Raid Frames

_**Update regarding WoW Midnight.**_

_Due to the changes Blizzard is making to addons in WoW Midnight, it looks like Enhanced Raid Frames will cease functioning. As I currently no longer play WoW and have been keeping the addon updated solely for the benefit of you all, I don't foresee Enhanced Raid Frames continuing once these changes go into effect. We had a good run, and it's been a pleasure developing addons for you all. Cheers,_

**Enhanced Raid Frames** is a raid frame add-on for **World of Warcraft**, **World of Warcraft: Classic** and
**World of Warcraft: Classic Era** that adds many small but significant features to enhance the (already quite awesome) 
built-in raid frames, allowing the raid frames to function much closer to add-ons such as Grid/Grid2 or VuhDo â€” the most 
notable addition being configurable aura indicators.

Along with options to adjust the out-of-range distance, frame scale, frame opacity, overlay target icons, and numerous
other small features, Enhanced Raid Frames adds 9 aura indicators for each raid member, forming a 3x3 grid overlaying
each unit frame. These indicators allow for showing the presence, countdown time, and stack size of buffs and debuffs in
any configuration that suits your needs, which has become absolutely vital for endgame content. While designed with
healing in mind, other common use cases for Enhanced Raid Frames include competitive PvP, endgame tanking, or really any
type of gaming that involves quick and easy access to vital information.
